# LeetCode Solutions Archive 🚀

This repository is a personal archive documenting my LeetCode problem-solving journey. It contains accepted solutions to various algorithmic challenges, focusing on data structures, algorithms, and clean, maintainable Java code.

## 📌 Repository Content
The repository is organized by problem slugs. Each problem has its own dedicated directory containing:

- **Problem Description**  
  A `README.md` file within the problem folder that includes the full problem statement, examples, and constraints.

- **Solution Code**  
  The accepted Java implementation of the problem, written following clean code principles and best practices.

## 📂 Project Structure
Folders are named after the problem’s slug for easy navigation.

Example:
```text
two-sum/
 ├── README.md
 └── TwoSum.java
